# RepayOnBehalfOf Project
Minimal frontend with Next JS, TypeScript, Chakra UI & Ethers/Wagmi and smart contract backend with Foundry to call Compound Finance's `repayBorrowBehalf` function to repay someone else's CDP (or your own on a separate wallet) through a simple frontend UI.

Plans to add The Graph to query Compound for existing CDPs later as well as update for v3.
